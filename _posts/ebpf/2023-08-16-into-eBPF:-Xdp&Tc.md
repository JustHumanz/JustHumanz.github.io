This is was part three or maybe will be last part of eBPF topic in my blog, on this i will talk about XDP or eXpress Data Path and Traffic Controll, well yeah many people know or see how powerfull eBPF on networking level since the popular product of eBPF is calium who made significant improve on mesh service.

Before we start how ebpf works on level network better if we understand how linux handle network first

## Linux Networking Stack

![big no](https://media.tenor.com/VyugKLEBolsAAAAC/bocchi-bocchi-the-rock.gif)

NO, NO NO NO i don't want to explain it to you, you can read it by your self on this [book](https://www.beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/split/), understanding about linux networking stack can be crucial for this topic 

## Linux Packet Filtering
Since we talk about eBPF who designed for filtering package so we need to understand how linux filtering packet at first place.

Let's start with the tools who loved from networking guy until the 'fancy latest' devops guy, yep tcpdump.
wait you already read the [packet filtering](https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf) paper did you? please read it, read it please, minimum you can read it until **The Filter Model** i'm begging to you ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º

if you already read it and still don't understand or kinda confused let me make it more simple

##### Packet Filtering without bpf

From those command the output was smillar but the process was very diffrent, well maybe you already guess it
